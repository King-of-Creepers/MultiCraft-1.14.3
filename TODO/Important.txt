like in the previous repo, there will be the code and a todo folder, 
i will upload the planned things (textures, models, etc) to that folder, 
and if you implement it into the mod, you need to move it to the right place and remove from here


im gonna modify this, cuz i need to commit something, only for testing discord webhook.
thats the third test commit, pls discord, WORK
okay, forth commit, this will work.
its fooled me!! didint worked! but why...
